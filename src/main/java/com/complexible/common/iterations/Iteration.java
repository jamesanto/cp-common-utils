 * <p>New iterator interface.  Mimics {@link java.util.Iterator} in signature, but throws exceptions from its methods and is closeable.
 * Intended for use in cases where the implementation is iterating over something such that calls to {@link #next} or {@link #hasNext}
 * could result in an exception -- perhaps they are reading over streams or lazily performing a calculation.  Similarly, the {@link #close}
 * method is provide to signal that the iterator is no longer being used and that it is safe to free up any resources that it was using.</p>
